</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Thanks for trying Greymatter.  Greymatter is a Web-based tool for the creation of weblogs 
(regularly-updated news- or journal-type sites) or online journals, allowing complete 
control over your weblog/journal while supporting such features as: the ability for 
users to post comments to your entries or cast "karma" votes on them, with no database 
used or required whatsoever; a template-based system that allows you to fully customise 
every aspect of your site's look and function, great or small; support for multiple 
weblog/journal authors, with fully-controllable individual access; a ban system for 
preventing malicious users from voting or posting on your site; nearly a hundred template 
variables that allow for extremely flexible styles and setups; easy and complete editing 
of any entry (including its comments) at any time; runs completely on your own account 
and is thus under your full control at all times; and, of course, "more"!
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
To install Greymatter, please carefully follow the instructions in 
the <a href="http://greymatterforum.proboards82.com">install.html</a> file.  
Greymatter is intended as a flexible "power tool" for webloggers & 
journal-keepers who are moderately comfortable with the HTML language 
(to customise Greymatter's templates).  Greymatter requires a server 
that fully supports CGI programs with Perl 5.6 installed, and is optimised 
for 800x600 or higher.
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>IMPORTANT NOTE:</B> If you're upgrading from an 
older version of Greymatter, please read 
the <a href="http://greymatterforum.proboards82.com">install.html</a> file 
for instructions on how to upgrade.</FONT>

</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
At present, Greymatter is a completely free program; you don't need to spend a 
cent to use it, or to download any updates from the Greysoft site whenever they're 
made available.  However, any donations (no requested fee, do what your heart 
dictates, if anything) or gift purchases made from 
the <A HREF="http://noahgrey.com/greysoft/">Greysoft site</A> would be more 
than welcome; I've put an immense amount of work into this program, and any 
donations (though again, of course, *not* required in any way) would definitely 
be the best incentive to keep me working on and updating it, or simply to let 
me know that this program's existence is appreciated.
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
In any event, donation or no donation, if you like using Greymatter then feel 
free to e-mail me at <A HREF="mailto:noah@noahgrey.com">noah@noahgrey.com</A>&#151;I'd love 
to hear from you.  (For most tech-support questions or comments and queries relating to 
its usage, please leave a post about it on Greymatter's 
discussion <a href="http://greymatterforum.proboards82.com">forums</a> instead; 
that way, everyone can benefit from the information.)

<font color=#000000><b>4. Security Considerations</B></FONT>
</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Greymatter requires that certain files and directories be writeable by the userid that the web server runs as. Normally, this is accomplished by making those files and directories world-writeable. If you have the flexibility to exec a CGI script under a different userid, then this userid is the only one that requires write privileges. Greymatter has not been tested extensively under a "CGI wrapper" but should work fine if you keep this need to write files in mind.
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Every attempt has been made to secure this set of scripts against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. However, it is worth noting that if security is a significant concern, disallowing comments entirely is the only way to be completely safe from XSS attacks. Greymatter has configuration options that allow you to filter the set of allowable tags in comments. You need to be aware that allowing HTML in comments with no restrictions can lead to your site being compromised.
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In Greymatter 1.3.1, author usernames and passwords are no longer exposed during a rebuild files operation. Please take note that using the cookie and bookmarklet options both have the potential to reveal your author login information. If you are not the sole user of a machine, you should not use the cookies or bookmarklets features.

<font color=#000000><b>5. Configuration Options</B></FONT>
</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The Configuration screen is where you set up Greymatter and tell it how you want it to work.  As explained in installation.htm, setting things up here will need to be your first order of business when you use Greymatter for the first time.  Whenever you change any of the settings here after your weblog/journal has already started, then it'd be a good idea to rebuild your files (see the "Rebuilding Your Files" section of the manual below) to make the appropriate changes visible on your site.  You can also run "Diagnostics & Repair" (indeed, you'll <I>need</I> to do so upon installation) to insure that all your files and paths are accessible and are working correctly.
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Since the various configuration options are now described within the program itself, descriptions of them aren't included here.

<p class=entryheader align=justify>
<font color=#000000><b>6. Entries & Archives</B></FONT>
</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Entries are what your weblog/journal is made of, and the "Add A New Entry" screen is where you'll post them.  There are three distinct elements to an entry that you can create: the subject, the main text, and the extended (or "more") text.
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
You must always give your entries a subject, for at least reference purposes, since entries are listed by subject when you select them from the Edit An Entry menu.  (However you want to use or display them in your weblog/journal, or whether you want them displayed anywhere on your site at all, is, of course, entirely up to you and how you configure your templates.)
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The Main Entry Text is intended to be the main body of your entry, and the extended text is for additional or supplemental information; you must always enter a main text, but the extended text is optional.  This is intended to help you make an entry's appearance on your main index, and on its entry page, distinct when you want them to be distinct; typically (as in the default templates included with Greymatter), you would use the main text for when entries appear in the body of your log, and if you have something more you want to say in an entry but don't want to dump it all on the main page, you'd enter it as extended text to appear in full on that entry's individual page.  (Also note that you can, if you wish, give normal and extended entries different formatting via your templates, or handle them in any distinct way you choose.)
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Finally, upon creating the entry, you're given the option whether or not you want to turn karma voting and comment posting on or off for this entry (the options won't appear if you've disabled karma and/or comments in Configuration, since disabling them overrides individual entry settings).  You also have the option to mark that entry to stay at the top of your main log (which you could set apart with custom formatting via the templates, for announcements, special notices, and so forth)owhen the main index is generated, then that entry will stay at the top indefinitely, until you edit it removing its stay-at-top status (or set another entry to take its place).
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
You can edit an entry anytime by selecting it from the "Edit An Entry" screen (entries are listed by subject in order from newest to oldest); this includes being able to edit or delete any comments from any entry, turning karma and/or comments on or off for that entry, and marking or removing it as the stay-at-top entry.  When you edit an entry, you also have the option to leave it "open" or make it "closed"&#151;meaning, basically, whether or not you want to leave that entry on your site.  Think of open as meaning "visible" and closed meaning "invisible"; all entries are, of course, open by default.  To close an entry is to effectively "delete" it&#151;when the relevant files are rebuilt, Greymatter will treat that entry as if it no longer exists, removing all links to it or traces of it&#151;but with the obvious advantage that Greymatter still has the entry data on file, and you could re-open it later if you wish.  Be sure to rebuild the appropriate files after saving any changes to an entry, to make those changes take immediate effect on your site.  (Greymatter automatically updates all relevant files whenever you add a new entry.)
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
An entry is considered "archived" when it becomes too old to be listed on your main index.  You specify in Configuration how many days' worth of entries you want to keep on your main index.  (This counts how many days you've posted entries for, *not* consecutive days; so for example, if you've posted entries only on four different days scattered throughout a month, Greymatter still counts that as four days.)
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Indexes of your archived logs are automatically created by Greymatter in your entries/archives directory, in monthly or weekly installments.  If you have the "Keep main index and archive log indexes concurrent with each other" option selected, then Greymatter will generate these files in your archives directory right away when you post entries and log your entries in both places simultaneously.  Otherwise, entries won't appear here, and these files won't be generated, until entries have "scrolled off" the main index.  Your archive master index is a good place to set up links to your archives; check the <A HREF="#7">Template Variables</A> section below for information about the {{log*list}} family of variables, which generate lists of these links automatically.  (The "Miscellaneous Templates" allow you to customise these lists.)

<font color=#000000><b>7. The Templates</B></FONT>
</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Templates are what Greymatter builds your site out of&#151;they're patterns that tell Greymatter how you want your site to look, how you want your content to be formatted, what information you want to include and exactly where you want to include it.  You mainly customise your templates with HTML (though since Greymatter generates *exactly* what the templates tell it to generate&#151;nothing more, nothing less&#151;you can also incorporate SHTML, PHP/SQL, or any other kinds of codes into your templates if you wish; you could even use Greymatter to generate text files or other specially-formatted documents if you wanted to), and you use the template variables (see the "Template Variables" sections below for a complete listing) to control what information you want to incorporate and where you want it to be placed.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Since the various templates are now described within the program itself, descriptions of them aren't included here.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><strong>Templates and Forms</strong><br />
Greymatter uses several html/cgi forms to perform certain vital tasks.  The tasks include karma voting, commenting, previewing, and searching.  When you modify your templates, you must be aware of certain bits of html that <em>need</em> to be present in order for your site to work.  Listed below are the form parameters and example code<br />
<ul>Karma Voting
<li>These forms are generate by Greymatter, no need to worry.</li>
</ul>

<ul>Searching (Edit Templates : Misc Templates : Search Templates)
<li>field with name="gmsearch".  Typically this is a input of type text, but could be a text area, or even a put into a link, for a predefined search.</li>
<li>field with value="Search".  Typically a submit type (button), but could be coded into a link that alwasy searches for 'fooo' such as: gm-comments.cgi?Search=1&gmsearch=fooo</li>
<li>Example:
<pre>	&lt;form action="{{cgiwebpath}}/gm-comments.cgi" method="post" &gt;&lt;input type="text" name="gmsearch" /&gt;
	&lt;input type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>Commenting (Edit Templates : Edit Commenting Templates)
<li>field with name="newcommententrynumber".  Typically this is a hidden field with value="{{entrynumber}}", this field is required so that Greymatter knows which entry to associate this comment to.</li>
<li>field with name="newcommentauthor".  Typically this is a text field, used by Greymatter for the Commenters Name.</li>
<li>field with name="newcommentemail".  Typicall a text field, used for the commenter's email address, Optional.</li>
<li>field with name="newcommenthomepage". Typically this is text field, used  for the commenter's homepage, Optional.</li>
<li>field with name="newcommentbody".  Typically this is a text area, but could be text field.  Used for the comment text.</li>
<li>field with name="gmpostpreview".  Should be a button, takes user to preview screen.</li>
<li>field with value="Submit". Should be a button, used to submit the comment.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Example:
<pre>	&lt;form action="{{cgiwebpath}}/gm-comments.cgi#comments" method="post"  &gt;
	&lt;input name="newcommententrynumber" type="hidden" value="{{entrynumber}}" /&gt;
	&lt;input name="newcommentauthor" type="text" /&gt;
	&lt;input name="newcommentemail" type="text" /&gt;
	&lt;input name="newcommenthomepage" type="text" /&gt;
	&lt;textarea name="newcommentbody" &gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
	&lt;input name="gmpostpreview" type="submit" value="Preview" /&gt;
	&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" /&gt;
	&lt;/form&gt;</pre></li>
</ul>

<ul>Previewing (Edit Templates : Edit Commenting Templates)
<li>field with name="newcommententrynumber".  Typically this is a hidden field with value="{{entrynumber}}", this field is required so that Greymatter knows which entry to associate this comment to.</li>
<li>field with name="newcommentauthor".  Typically this is a hidden field with value="{{previewcommentauthor}}", but could be text field.  Used by Greymatter for the Commenters Name.</li>
<li>field with name="newcommentemail".  Typically this is a hidden field with value="{{previewcommentemail}}", but could be text field.  Used for the commenter's email address, Optional.</li>
<li>field with name="newcommenthomepage". Typically this is a hidden field with value="{{previewcommenthomepage}}", but could be text field.  Used  for the commenter's homepage, Optional.</li>
<li>field with name="newcommentbody".  Typically this is a hidden field with value="{{previewcommentbody}}", but could be text field.  Used for the comment text.</li>
<li>field with name="previewrand".  Should be a hidden field with value="{{previewrand}}".  Used when confirming a preview with a random hidden number.</li>
<li>field with name="postit". Should be a button, used to submit the comment.</li>

<li>Example:
<pre> 	&lt;form action="{{cgiwebpath}}/gm-comments.cgi" method="post"&gt;
	&lt;input type="hidden" name="newcommententrynumber" value="{{entrynumber}}" /&gt;
	&lt;input type="hidden" name="newcommentauthor" value="{{previewcommentauthor}}" /&gt;

<font color=#000000><b>8. Template Variables</B></FONT>
</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Think of variables as placeholders for dynamic information (since that's exactly what they are)&#151;each variable represents some piece of info or code, and their placement in your templates tells Greymatter where you want that info to be included.  Variables are usually context-dependent; for example, a date/time variable like {{month}} or {{hour}}, in the context of the Individual Entry Template, will display the numbers for the month and hour respectively in which that entry was posted, or in the context of the Comments Template, the month and hour in which that comment was posted.  Some variables (for example, {{header}}, {{footer}} and {{sidebar}}) have their own templates; in those cases, Greymatter inserts the contents of those templates wherever those variables are and then goes on analyzing the rest of the variables.  A few variables can only be used in a particular instance, but most are intended to be used as flexibly as you like.
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The template variables are as follows:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{ampm}}, {{ampmlower}}, {{ampmdot}}, {{ampmdotlower}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The AM or PM status of the relevant time.  The "lower" variations list it in lowercase ("am" or "pm"), and the dot variations list it with dots ("a.m." or "p.m.").

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{archivebody}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Placeholder for use only in the Archive Log Index Template; when the log archives are generated, this tells Greymatter where to place the body of that month's or week's log.  You can also use {{logbody}} (see below) to do the same thing.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{author}}, {{authoremail}}, {{authorhomepage}}, {{authorentrycount}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The name of that entry's author, their e-mail address (if given), their homepage address (if given), and the total number of entries they've posted so far, respectively.  You can also include the name of an author to <I>always</I> give the relevant status for that particular author; for example, {{authoremail Alice}} will give Alice's e-mail address (if there is one), {{authorentrycount Mad Hatter}} will display how many entries Mad Hatter has posted, and so on.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{authorsmartlink}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Displays the name of that entry's author as a link either to that author's e-mail or homepage address, whichever has been given (if both are available, the link is to that author's homepage; if neither, the name is left unlinked).  This is a self-contained link.  As above, you can also names to generate smart dynamic links for specific authors.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{calendar}}, {{calendar [mm]/[yy]}}, {{calendarweek}}</B></FONT>

Creates calendar displays for the current month or week (or, in the case of {{calendar [mm]/[yy]}}, the month you specify) with each day in the calendar display as a link to the most recent entry posted that day, if any; you can specify in configuration whether calendars will link to any entry or only to extended entries.  Use {{calendar [mm]/[yy]}} to create a calendar for a specific month; for example, {{calendar 11/00}} would make a calendar for the month of November 2000.  (This requires that you've actually posted at least one entry during that month.)

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{link [url]}}, {{link [url] [link text]}}, {{linkmo [url] [link text]|[mouseover]}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
For use when adding new entries, to facilitate adding links as a kind of shorthand.  (You can always do them the old-fashioned way too, of course.)  Links added this way are self-contained.  The syntax works as follows:
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<UL>
<LI> Typing "Check this site out: {{{link http://noahgrey.com/}}" produces "Check this site out: <A HREF="http://noahgrey.com/">http://noahgrey.com/</A>" with the URL as a plain link.
<LI> Typing "Say, have you been to {{link http://noahgrey.com/ Noah's site}} lately?" produces "Say, have you been to <A HREF="http://noahgrey.com/">Noah's site</A> lately?" with the words "Noah's site" as a 
link to noahgrey.com.
<LI> Typing "Really, you MUST {{linkmo http://noahgrey.com/ go there|Click here!}} sometime!" produces "Really, you MUST <A HREF="http://noahgrey.com/" onMouseOver="window.status='Click here!';return true" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true">go there</A> sometime!" with the words "go there" as a link to noahgrey.com, and the words "Click here!" appearing as mouseover text for that link in the browser's status bar.
</UL>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
You can also use "email" and "emailmo", with the same syntax as above (replacing "link" or "linkmo" accordingly), for linking to e-mail addresses.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{logbody}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Placeholder for use only in the Main Index or Archive Log Index Templates; when the log is generated, this tells Greymatter where to place the body of the log (the current log for the main index, and the monthly/weekly log for the archive log index).
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{logentrylist}}, {{logshortentrylist}}, {{logmoreentrylist}} (plus optional variants: day, month, year, firsthalf, secondhalf, number, comments, commentsminimum, commentsnumber, and author name)</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Generates a list of links to your individual entry pages (unless you have those disabled).  The appearance of these links is controlled by the Entry List Link templates (under Miscellaneous Templates) and the Entry List Link Separator.  {{logentrylist}} generates a list of links to all your entries; {{logshortentrylist}} generates a list for non-extended entries only, and {{logmoreentrylist}} for extended entries only.  With each of those you can optionally specify that only a particular range of entries be listed:
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<UL>
<LI> day&#151;lists the entries only for the most recent day that entries were posted
<LI> month&#151;lists the entries only for the most recent month
<LI> year&#151;lists the entries only for the most recent year
<LI> firsthalf&#151;lists the first (most recent) half of all entries
<LI> secondhalf&#151;lists the second (older) half of all entries
<LI> number&#151;lists the most recent number of however many entries you specify in Configuration
<LI> comments&#151;lists entries sorted by the number of comments they've received
<LI> commentsminimum&#151;same as above, but lists entries only if they've received at least one comment
<LI> commentsnumber&#151;lists the top X most-posted-to entries (X being whatever you specified in Configuration)
<LI> (name of any author)&#151;lists all entries by that particular author
</UL>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
So, for example, {{logshortentrylist month}} would list all the non-extended entries for the current month; {{logentrylist firsthalf}} and {{logentrylist secondhalf}} would list all the entries in separate halves (useful if you want to list them in two columns); {{logmoreentrylist number}} would list the twenty most recent extended entries, if you have "Log entry list variable number" in Configuration set to 20; {{logentrylist commentsminimum}} lists all entries, sorted by number of comments, that have received at least one comment (you can specify in Configuration whether or not this only lists entries for which comments can still be posted to); {{logmoreentrylist commentsnumber}} would list the top five most-posted-to entries if you have "Log entry list variable number" in Configuration set to 5; {{logentrylist WhiteRabbit}} would list all entries written by WhiteRabbit; and so on.

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{militaryhour}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Displays the number of the relevant hour, in military time (always double-digit).  The custom in military time is to add twelve to any hour after noon; so for example, 2 PM would be 14 in military time.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{minute}}, {{minuteminute}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Displays the number of the relevant minute.  {{minuteminute}} forces it to two digits (if it's not already), padding single-digit numbers with zeroes (for example, 5 becomes 05).
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{month}}, {{monthmonth}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Displays the number of the relevant month.  {{monthmonth}} forces it to two digits (if it's not already), padding single-digit numbers with zeroes (for example, 3 becomes 03).
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{monthword}}, {{monthwordupper}}, {{monthwordlower}}, {{monthwordshort}}, {{monthworduppershort}}, {{monthwordlowershort}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Displays the name of the month; {{monthwordshort}} displays it abbreviated to three letters.  The "upper" and "lower" variations for both are for displaying it in upper- or lowercase respectively.  So for example, the month of December would be displayed by the variables like so, in the order they're listed above: December, DECEMBER, december, Dec, DEC, dec.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>{{morelink}}, {{morepreface}} (deprecated)</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The contents of their respective templates; will only appear with entries that have an 
extended ("more") text.  These are no longer recommended for use; it's simpler and more 
flexible now to distinguish standard and extended entries with their separate templates, 
so these are no longer necessary (but are kept for compatibility purposes).  <b>NOTE</b>
These have not been honored since at least GM 1.3.1 and should not be used.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{next}} and {{nextmore}} as a prefix</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
When "next" or "nextmore" is used as a prefix to most variables, it will give the relevant variable output as it pertains to the next standard or extended entry; for example, {{nexthour}} gives the next entry's hour, {{nextmoreentrysubject}} the next extended entry's subject, and so on.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{pagelink}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{pageindexlink}}, {{pagearchiveindexlink}}, {{pagearchivelogindexlink}}</B></FONT>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{pagesmartindexlink}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Generates a "smart" link either to the main index page or, if the entry is an archived entry, to the log archives for that entry's month or week.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{popup [filename] [title] [width]x[height]}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Generates a popup window for images, as well as an HTML file for that popup window in the entries/archives directory (both according to the popup templates you specify).  "Filename" is the name of the image file (the HTML file Greymatter creates for the window will be named based on this file as well), "title" is its title, and "width" and "height" are the image's width and height respectively.  {{popup}} creates its link and HTML file according to your customisation of them in the templates.  So, for example, {{popup me.jpg This is me 300x200}} would create a popup window for the me.jpg image in the entries/archives directory (creating a me.htm file there for the window as well) that is 300 pixels wide and 200 pixels high.  Note that when you upload an image through Greymatter, you can have it automatically create a new entry with the correct {{popup}} variable already in place.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{popupfile}}, {{popuphtmlfile}}, {{popuptitle}}, {{popupwidth}}, {{popupheight}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Gives the image filename, HTML filename, title, width, and height respectively, from the popup variable above.  These variables will, of course, only work in the popup templates.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{positivekarma}}, {{negativekarma}}, {{totalkarma}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The positive, negative and total karma ratings of that entry, respectively.  If used outside the {{karmalink}} and {{entrykarmaform}} templates, these will just show up as permanent zeroes for entries on which karma is disabled or if karma voting is disabled altogether.  Total karma is the positive minus the negative karma votes; 10 positive votes with 3 negative would give a 7 total karma rating, 4 positive with 7 negative would give -3 total.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{positivekarmalink}}, {{negativekarmalink}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Generates links for voting upon that entry's karma for the positive or the negative respectively.  If used outside the {{entrykarmaform}} or {{karmalink}} templates, these links will always appear whether or not karma voting is enabled for that entry or if karma is disabled altogether (if karma's disabled, though, clicking the links will not alter that entry's karma).
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{previewcommentauthor}}, {{previewcommentemail}}, {{previewcommenthomepage}}, {{previewcommentbody}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

When "previous" or "previousmore" is used as a prefix to most variables, it will give the relevant variable output as it pertains to the previous standard or extended entry; for example, {{previoushour}} gives the previous entry's hour, {{previousmoreentrysubject}} the previous extended entry's subject, and so on.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{previouslink}}, {{nextlink}}, {{previousmorelink}}, {{nextmorelink}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Inserts the contents of their respective templates, intended for use in linking to previous or next entries (or, with the "more" variations, previous/next extended entries).  These will only appear if there's a non-closed previous/next entry (or extended entry, respectively) to be linked to. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>{{randomnumber [x]-[y]}}</B></FONT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
To post an entry to your weblog/journal&#151;to access Greymatter or do anything with it at all, for that matter&#151;you have to be a registered author.  (The default author is "Alice", password "wonderland".)  You can control the specific access of any author registered with Greymatter&#151;for example, if you want to create an account for someone that can post entries to your weblog/journal, but you don't want them having the ability to muck up your site's configuration or to do anything else.  (Needless to say, be careful about turning off your own access to anything!)  Likewise, of course, you can also delete an author's account altogether at any time.
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
To create a new author account, simply enter the desired name and password in the "Register A New Author" box, as well as that person's e-mail and/or homepage (this is optional).  If you leave the "All access on for this author by default?" checkbox on, then that author will be created having access to everything; if you leave it unchecked, then they'll be created having access to nothing.  After creating the author, edit them if you want to specifically turn their access on or off for different functions.  There is no theoretical limit to how many authors you can register.

</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
If someone's being a pain and you want to ban them from posting comments to your site or casting karma votes on any of the entries, you can add their IP address to the Banned IP list.  You can also optionally specify a name to go along with the banned IPs, to help you remember who's who, and, of course, you can remove a banned IP from the list at any time.  (In a nutshell, IP addresses are four-digit numbers&#151;in the format x.x.x.x&#151;which usually specify an individual account accessing the Internet; a full explanation of IPs is beyond the scope of this manual.)  You can see the IP address of someone posting a comment or voting on karma whenever an e-mail notification is sent to you (if you have that enabled), or by reviewing that entry in the "Edit An Entry" screen.
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Since some internet service providers use "rolling" (non-static) IPs, you can enter a partial IP if you want to ban all IP numbers that contain the given partial IP string; for example, banning "12.34.56" would ban the IP "12.34.56.78" as well as "90.12.34.56".

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
From time to time, you may want to rebuild your files&#151;to rebuild files basically means to tell Greymatter to regenerate them.  You'll usually only want to do this after you've made changes to your configuration settings, after you've edited your templates, or after you've edited an entry (including closing or reopening it).  For example, if you've changed the entry page templates for current entries, you'll probably just want to rebuild the main entry pages&#151;and if you've made changes affecting the entire look or operation of your site, you'll want to rebuild everything.  Most of the time, though, rebuilding should be quite unnecessary.
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Remember that, obviously, some of these operations may take some time, depending on how much is involved in the rebuilding&#151;most rebuilding operations should be fairly quick, but major rebuilding over a large number of entries could take a little while.  DO NOT attempt to abort Greymatter in any way once you've started rebuilding, or you may mess up your files!

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The following are some things you might like to consider after you've become comfortable with using and customising Greymatter.
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>1. Using Greymatter to do an online journal</B></FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Although Greymatter's default inclination is towards weblogs, it can also be used as a flexible tool for maintaining an online journal with, to which you could have visitors post comments to your journal entries.  For starters, try editing your templates to leave the date grouping template blank, and in the individual entry template, list only the date and entry subject&#151;for example, a one-line template like so:
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>
{{month}}/{{day}}/{{year}}: {{pagelink}}{{entrysubject}}
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
would make for a quick-and-easy "table of contents" type of format, and you could use the main index as your table of contents for current journal entries.  (You might also want to try bumping up the "Days to keep on main index" variable to a much higher number - even a number like 99999, which would in effect make the main index a table-of-contents list of all entries.)
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>2. Tying variables to graphics (suggested by Jay Barrow)</B></FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Greymatter's template variables don't have to only be used for outputting plain text&#151;try using them to automatically insert particular graphics as well.  For instance, say that you have a series of twelve GIFs, one for every month, displaying that month's name in a special visual way&#151;january.gif, february.gif, etc.  In this case, use a tag like "&lt;IMG SRC="{{monthwordlower}}.gif"&gt;", and Greymatter will automatically insert the appropriate month word (in this instance, in lowercase) in the image tag.  You could also use it to, say, associate particular graphics/icons to particular people if you have multiple authors in your weblog/journal and wanted to set them apart.
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>3. Using Greymatter for database-type sites like movie/music review sites, etc.</B></FONT>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Remember that you're not constrained to think of "main text", "more text" or anything else with their default meanings, or to use Greymatter's templates only in the same way all the time.  Let's say that you want to run a site for music reviews.  Set up your main index page in a table-of-contents type of format (as suggested under "Using Greymatter to do an online journal" above).  When you add reviews, your "subject" can be the title of the CD you're reviewing, your "main text" could be some miscellaneous info (the release date, the label, a summary of your review, etc) that you want to set apart somehow, and the "more text" could be the review itself&#151;format your templates accordingly.  And you could use karma ratings, but instead call it: "Do you like this album?  Yes/No", for example.
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Despite the way Greymatter names things, it's not intended to be a program where you must always think "this is what I have to do here" and "that's what I have to do there" - take the time to learn how Greymatter works, and feel free to make it all into whatever *you* want to be.

<font color=#000000><b>13. Troubleshooting</B></FONT>
</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
First, assuming you can run Greymatter at all, be sure to run "Diagnostics & Repair" on the 
Configuration screen if you're having problems; that should be able to tell you what most of 
the holdups are, if Greymatter hasn't done so already along the way&#151;whenever Greymatter 
has trouble accessing a file, it should stop and tell you what the problem is.  You might also 
want to contact your server operator or webhost to find out if your server has any special 
limitations when running Perl software.  Also, don't forget to check the discussion board at 
the <A HREF="http://greymatterforum.proboards82.com/">Greymatter Forums</A>; someone (including me) 
may be able to answer your problem there, if it hasn't been answered already.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
PROBLEM: I keep getting a 500 Internal Service Error when I attempt to run Greymatter, or 
at a particular spot while attempting to do something in Greymatter.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
DIAGNOSIS: First, check to make sure that you've uploaded everything in ASCII mode via your 
FTP program; if you're unsure, reupload all the files making sure that each upload is in 
ASCII mode.  Next, check to make sure that your Perl pointers are correctly set, as specified 
in the installation instructions; then, double-check that everything is 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=chmod" target="_blank">CHMOD</a>ed 
correctly, also as specified in the installation instructions.  If it still won't 
run after all that, then your server might not have Perl 5 or its standard modules installed.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
PROBLEM: I can't seem to configure my paths correctly.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
DIAGNOSIS: If you're absolutely certain that your paths are as they should be, 
and "Diagnostics & Repair" still gives you error notices, then try using virtual 
instead of relative paths instead. For example, your local CGI path would simply be a "." 
period (that just means "this directory is right where I'm running from"), and if 
your entries directory is a subdirectory of that named "archives", then your local 
entries path would be "./archives". Use "../" for going back one directory relative 
to the current one (where gm.cgi is); for example, if you have gm.cgi in /cgi-bin/gmfiles/ 
and you want your log path to be in /www/weblog/, you'd use "../../www/weblog"othe "../../" 
going back two directories and into "/www/weblog" from there. (Without the quotes, in all instances.)
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
PROBLEM: I get "Forbidden" errors whenever I try to view my main index and/or any of my entries.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
DIAGNOSIS: If you've got your main index in your account's cgi-bin directory, and/or 
your entries directory as a subdirectory of that, then your server is probably set to 
automatically disallow viewing of any files in your cgi-bin directory (or 
subdirectories thereof) as a security measure.  You'll have to have your log 
directory and your entries/archives directory to be somewhere other than in the 
cgi-bin directory.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
PROBLEM: My entries or other files are messed up, and/or Greymatter just stalls 
out and stops running whenever I attempt to do something.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
DIAGNOSIS: You may have interrupted Greymatter in the middle of an operation, 
such as adding a new entry or rebuilding files. <B>Never</B> do this, since this 
is the surest way to corrupt your Greymatter files.  Keep in mind that actions 
like rebuilding files will always take some time, depending on how much Greymatter 
has to rebuild; if you have large templates, and/or you're trying to rebuild a 
significant amount of entries (and/or if entries contain a significant amount of 
comments), then rebuilding will probably require an ample amount of time.  If your 
files have indeed been definitely corrupted, there will probably be no choice but 
to reinstall from scratch.  If you believe you've encountered a genuine bug that 
corrupted your files through no fault of your own, then please don't hesitate to 
<A HREF="mailto:noah@noahgrey.com">report it to me</A>.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
PROBLEM: I try to run Greymatter and get a bunch of text, but can't get the 
program to run properly; or, whenever I try to access Greymatter I'm simply 
prompted to download gm.cgi instead.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
DIAGNOSIS: Your server may not have Perl 5 installed, or it may not be properly 
configured to run CGI scripts (*or* it may not allow for running CGI at all).
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
PROBLEM: I get an error when running Grey Matter.  It complains about not being able
to find the library 'warnings'.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
DIAGNOSIS: Your server may not have Perl 5.6 (released in 2000) installed, or 
the cgi scripts are not pointed at it (Sometimes more than one version of Perl 
is installed on a machine).  Ask your webhost or ISP where the newest version of
Perl is located and update the cgi scripts with the path).
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
PROBLEM: I get an error when running Grey Matter.  It complains about not being able
to find the 'libs' directory or can't find Gm_(whatever) (usually Gm_Constants).
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
DIAGNOSIS: You need to upload the 'libs' (and all files withen) directory and set the appropriatte 
permissions.  The 'libs' directory should be under your cgi-bin directory where
gm.cgi and the other scripts are located.  The 'libs' directory and the files withen
were added in an effort to modularize GreyMatter and isolate similar code into
seperate files.  Also make sure that the 'libs' directory is chmod'ed to 755, other permissions may 
prevent your webserver from viewing the file.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
PROBLEM: I get an error when running Grey Matter.  It complains about a file being forbidden/denied access to.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
DIAGNOSIS: Sometimes a file such as gm.cgi can be given too many permissions.  Some webservers,
such as Apache, can be setup to not execute Perl/cgi scripts that have execute and write permissions
for group and world.  Chmod 777 ('-rwxrwxrwx') vs chmmod 755 ('-rwxr-xr-x').
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
PROBLEM: I get odd behavior from GreyMatter such as a blank screen during rebuild, failure to rebuilt,
blank pages after rebuilding, etc.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
DIAGNOSIS: GreyMatter depends on being able to read files, line by line.  However, Windows uses
a different line ending character than Linxu/Mac/etc. and so GM will read a file like gm-config.cgi
and see it as one big line, which means, none of your configurations will be loaded into GreyMatter 
(same for gm-templates.cgi, etc.).

There are several things to solve this issue:
<ul>
<li>Reupload a fresh file, if its a new install, or you haven't made any changes.  FTP programs will have a way
to specify to send a file in ASCII, consult google or your ftp program's help.</li>
<li>You could try downloading the file to your local machine, then re-uploading, making sure to set your FTP program 
to ASCII (same as above).  Downloading and re-uploading will cleanse the file.
<li>If you have modified a file directly, make sure you do 'save as text' or plain text or ascii.  Some 
editing programs will insert bad characters, such as windows line endings, into the file when saving.</li>
<li>This program http://www.comparatorfast.com/ will may help.
Under - tools-misc, you have a dos-unix conversion program to get rid of the windows endings.
The program is shareware it will work for 30 days.</li>

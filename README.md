# Changes
- Updated all existing (docs) and generated HTML to be valid HTML5. As part of this process, I edited all of the admin, generated blog, and existing (doc) HTML pages and fixed all parsing errors that I could find.

- Moved CSS/JS to their own respective files. This greatly simplifies the amount of text that needs to be stored in the individual HTML and CGI files

- Updated the CSS and CGI templates to be fully HTML5 valid/compliant

- Updated branding/versioning/forum links throughout

- Added a simple shell script that will generate folders/chmod needed files for correct operation 

- Added some new GM icons I created and/or found around the web

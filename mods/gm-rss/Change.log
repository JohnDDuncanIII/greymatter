Version (1.0.3a) 04/06/06 (Change Your Image Version)
No change to the code, just changed the RDF image to an RSS one. The history behind my reason for shipping the RDF image is well.... lets just say I was wrong and you should change your image to the new RSS one.

the poster of an item, the date posted, and the time.

Version (0.5.1) 14/6/03 (The never release software on Friday 13th version)

Fixed a bug that crept in with version 0.5.0. This was causing the links to 
each entry to be built incorrectly eg:
http://www.example.com/archives/00000007.html
was being built as:
http://www.example.com/archives00000007.html

Version (0.5.0) 13/6/03

Removed the XML directory. This was just not working out.
You will need to check with your hosting service that the required modules are
available. (See README)
Fixed bug where the suffix for the entry files was fixed as .html
The suffix is now obtained from the Greymatter configuration file.
